# GIPHYAPP
This project is an application that queries the GIPHY API for GIFs relating to a specific topic.

This project was designed and built by Mike Mooney using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery.

When the app is opened, the page is populated with buttons with the name of a topic within a category. Clicking this button will query the GIPHY API and return 10 static images. The images can be clicked which plays the GIF. 

The user can also add new topics using the submit form. When this is done, a new button is made for the topic, which can be clicked to deliver 10 GIFs as well. 

The rating of the GIF is also showed beneath it when they populate the page.

This project is web-based and can be used with most web browsers.
